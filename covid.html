    <h2 class="subhead">MYTHS AND FACTS ABOUTS COVID-19 VACCINE</h2>
    <p class="text">
      <br>
      <b>MYTH</b>: The ingredients in COVID-19 vaccines are dangerous.<br><br>
      <b>FACT</b>: Nearly all the ingredients in COVID-19 vaccines are also ingredients in many foods â€“
       fats, sugars, and salts.<br><br><br>
      <b>MYTH</b>: The natural immunity I get from being sick with COVID-19 is better than the immunity I get from COVID-19 vaccination.<br><br>
      <b>FACT</b>: Getting a COVID-19 vaccination is a safer and more dependable way to build immunity to COVID-19 than getting sick with COVID-19.<br><br><br>
      <b>MYTH</b>: COVID-19 vaccines cause variants.<br><br>
      <b>FACT</b>: COVID-19 vaccines do not create or cause variants of the virus that causes COVID-19. Instead, COVID-19 vaccines can help prevent new variants from emerging.<br><br><br>
      <b>MYTH</b>: All events reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) are caused by vaccination.<br><br>
      <b>FACT</b>: Anyone can report events to VAERS, even if it is not clear whether a vaccine caused the problem. Because of this, VAERS data alone cannot determine if the reported adverse event was caused by a COVID-19 vaccination.<br><br><br>
      <b>MYTH</b>: The mRNA vaccine is not considered a vaccine.<br><br>
      <b>FACT</b>: mRNA vaccines, such as Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, work differently than other types of vaccines, but they still trigger an immune response inside your body.<br><br><br>
      <b>MYTH</b>: COVID-19 vaccines contain microchips.<br><br>
      <b>FACT</b>: COVID-19 vaccines do not contain microchips. Vaccines are developed to fight against disease and are not administered to track your movement.<br><br><br>
      <b>MYTH</b>: Receiving a COVID-19 vaccine can make you magnetic.<br><br>
      <b>FACT</b>: Receiving a COVID-19 vaccine will not make you magnetic, including at the site of vaccination which is usually your arm.<br><br><br>
      <b>MYTH</b>: COVID-19 vaccines authorized for use in the United States shed or release their components.<br><br>
      <b>FACT</b>: Vaccine shedding is the release or discharge of any of the vaccine components in or outside of the body and can only occur when a vaccine contains a live weakened version of the virus.<br><br><br>
      <b>MYTH</b>: COVID-19 vaccines can alter my DNA.<br><br>
      <b>FACT</b>: COVID-19 vaccines do not change or interact with your DNA in any way.<br><br><br>
      <b>MYTH</b>: A COVID-19 vaccine can make me sick with COVID-19.<br><br>
      <b>FACT</b>: Because none of the authorized COVID-19 vaccines in the United States contain the live virus that causes COVID-19, the vaccine cannot make you sick with COVID-19.<br><br><br>
